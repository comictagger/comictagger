ComicTagger is a multi-platform app for writing metadata to digital comics, written in Python and PyQt.

Features:

* Runs on Mac OSX, Microsoft Windows, and Linux systems
* Communicates with an online database (Comic Vine) for acquiring metadata
* Uses image processing to automatically match a given archive with the correct issue data
* Batch processing in the GUI for tagging hundreds or more comics at a time
* Reads and writes multiple tagging schemes ( ComicBookLover and ComicRack, with more planned).
* Reads and writes RAR and Zip archives (external tools needed for writing RAR)
* Command line interface (CLI) on all platforms (including Windows), which supports batch operations, and which can be used in native scripts for complex operations.

Requires:

* python 2.6 or 2.7
* configparser
* python imaging (PIL) >= 1.1.6
* beautifulsoup > 4.1

Optional requirement (for GUI):
