This is a fork derived from google code:

  https://code.google.com/p/comictagger/


Changes in this fork:
 - Updated to use rarfile as it has been more recently maintained
 - extracted core libraries in its own package comicapi, shared in a new repository using git subtree for better
   alignment with comicstreamer
 - support for *day of month* field in the GUI
 - merge of changes from fcanc fork

Todo:
 - more tests in non-linux platforms
 - repackage for simple user installation

Follows original readme:

ComicTagger is a multi-platform app for writing metadata to digital comics, written in Python and PyQt.

Features:

* Runs on Mac OSX, Microsoft Windows, and Linux systems
* Communicates with an online database (Comic Vine) for acquiring metadata
* Uses image processing to automatically match a given archive with the correct issue data
* Batch processing in the GUI for tagging hundreds or more comics at a time
* Reads and writes multiple tagging schemes ( ComicBookLover and ComicRack, with more planned).
* Reads and writes RAR and Zip archives (external tools needed for writing RAR)
* Command line interface (CLI) on all platforms (including Windows), which supports batch operations, and which can be
  used in native scripts for complex operations. For example, to recursively scrape and tag all archives in a folder
	comictagger.py -R -s -o -f -t cr -v -i --nooverwrite /path/to/comics/
